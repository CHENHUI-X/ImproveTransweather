# Transweather
- Pytorch implementation for TransWeather -- CVPR 2022

- Original paper : [TransWeather: Transformer-based Restoration of Images Degraded by Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14813)

- Note : Most of the code in this repository comes from the [original author's repository](https://github.com/jeya-maria-jose/TransWeather). Here, it is more about fine-tuning the source code, adding a lot of comments, and adding some other details. (At the time of completing this repository, some details of the original author's code were not completed, so if the original author has an update, I will continue to follow up.)

- Plus, the original paper uses a larger dataset, which is inconvenient for people who just learn the model architecture and run the code successfully. So I sampled 600 images from the original dataset, 480 for training and 180 for testing, which you can download here:[Allweather_subset.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v1z7NRyF9wD6wAlZBbphBZgTuIs8zOas/view?usp=sharing), it's only 160mb.
